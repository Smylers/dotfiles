# Smylers's Readline configuration


# Normally don't permit readline to beep (for things such as trying to move
# before the first character, or cycling past the end of possible completions):
set bell-style none

# But continue to let Ctrl+G provide beeps on request.  For some reason mapping
# this to the readline sequence "\a" doesn't work, so use the echo command
# instead -- with Ctrl+U and Ctrl+K before it to remove anything currently on
# the line (so that it is a valid command):
"\C-g": "\C-U\C-Kecho -en '\\a'\C-M"

# completion:
"\C-i": menu-complete
"\e[Z": menu-complete-backward
# (Shift+Tab, it seems, found with sed -n l.)

# Make Up and Down only cycle through previous commands with the already-typed
# prefix (Ctrl+P and Ctrl+N retain their original meanings if needed); allow
# for both sets of keycodes that seem to be used for the cursor keys:
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\eOA": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward
"\eOB": history-search-forward

# For some reason on some systems setting the above stops <Left> and <Right>
# working, so explicitly set them back to their defaults:
"\e[C": forward-char
"\e[D": backward-char

set revert-all-at-newline on

# Ctrl+] and Meta+Ctrl+] are hard to remember and not that easy to type, so
# provide alternatives.  The mnemonic is that Meta+A and Meta+E are movements
# in the direction of where Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E would go:
"\ea": character-search-backward
"\ee": character-search

# Make Meta+O be for adding an option to the previous command -- go up to the
# previous command, then to the beginning of the line, then one word forward,
# then insert a space, leaving the cursor at exactly the right position for
# typing an option before any other arguments:
"\eo": "\C-p\C-a\C-]  "

# Alt+Up changes up a directory:
"\e[1;3A": "\C-U\C-Kcd ..\C-M"

# Alt+Back goes to the previous directory:
"\e[1;3D": "\C-U\C-Kcd -\C-M"

# history expansion:
$if Bash
  Space: magic-space

  # Meta+, repeats the argument just typed:
  "\e,": "!#$ \b"
