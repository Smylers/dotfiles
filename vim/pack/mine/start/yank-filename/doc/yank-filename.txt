*yank-filename.txt*                Plugin for yanking the filename to X selection

                                                                             *gy*
To yank the current filename to the X selection, type gy â€” then it will be
available for inserting in other applications with the middle mouse button or
pressing <S-Ins>.

To change the keystrokes that do this, define a mapping before loading the
plugin like this (replacing gy with whatever you want):

  nmap <unique> gy <Plug>Yankfilename;
