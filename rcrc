# Have generic config in one tree, and tagged config with person ID in a
# separate one, which can be kept more private:
DOTFILES_DIRS=~/.dotfiles" "~/.id

# Allow the dotfiles repository to store additional files which aren't
# installed elsewhere, for programmes which don't have RC files or need them
# customizing in some way. Mark these with a leading underscore, so they stand
# out in the directory listing, and to make them easy to exclude from being
# installed; nothing uses ~/._*:
EXCLUDES="_*"

# Visible share directory for icons and the like:
UNDOTTED="share"

# If the Quod Libet station databases are symlinks, it just overrwrites them
# with new files anyway, so they may as well be files to start with:
COPY_ALWAYS="config/quodlibet/stations*"
