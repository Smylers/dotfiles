# In the commit list show commit IDs; abbreviate the author to initials (since
# it's usually me or otherwise not relevant, but that's enough to distinguish
# people on small teams); relative dates, just wide enough to fit in enough to
# be readable; and the commit graph before the messages:
set main-view = id author:width=2 date:relative,width=8 commit-title:graph=v2,refs

# Commit graph with nice line characters:
set line-graphics = utf-8

# Default to diff -w, because that's usually more illuminating of the intention
# behind a commit:
set ignore-space = all

# Search case-insensitively by default:
set ignore-case = smart-case

# Bright yellow and cyan aren't readable on a pale background, so instead make
# them normal shades but reversed:
color main-tracked		yellow	default	standout
color main-head			cyan	default	standout
